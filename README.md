# The Weatherton 3000

## Description

The Weatherton 3000 is a mock up Weather Forcast Webpage.
 - My motive for this project was to make a working Weather Forcast Website that would allow me to plan future road trips.
 - I built this project to learn more about Jquery, I dived more into using jquery as it is one of my weak points and I had came out a better coder then I was, I also Had to learn how to use insomnia.
 - This can be used to plan future road trips.
 - I've learned that things are hard to figure out, and with time, you can do it.
 - I've also learned more jquery and am more comfortable with it.

## Usage

When the page is loaded up:
 - it has the a fun header and even funnier footer.
 - it has a text area and a search button.

When I click the button:
  - it searches for the city that I had put into it.

After some seaching,
 - I can click some buttons with diffrent city names.
 - When they are clicked they bring back the information on those cities.

On this homework, We were diving to insomnia, as much as I have insomnia and don't want it, I have this and don't want it. I know that it can be proven very useful and I'm doing my bets to understand it, but I will have to keep trying until I can understand it.

At the Bottom I'd like to add fun facts but due to the time limit, I'm going to keep it as if.
